* Activation of the door lock device

## Fast Integration

1. Add tuya maven address in root `build.gradle` 

    ```groovy
    allprojects {
      repositories {
      // tuya maven url
      maven {
        url "https://maven-other.tuya.com/repository/maven-releases/"
      }
      maven {
        url "https://maven-other.tuya.com/repository/maven-snapshots/"
      }
      google()
        jcenter()
      }
    }
    ```
2. Add the door lock SDK dependency in the dependencies of `build.gradle` in the module layer

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        ...
       implementation 'com.tuya.smart:tuyasmart-lock-sdk:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT'
    }
    ```
